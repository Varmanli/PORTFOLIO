# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

## Features

- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, static site generation, and fast performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling and responsive design.
- **Framer Motion**: Easy-to-use animations and transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
